# Blazor Server Application Project Template

This is the new project template I will be using for most my blog post.  It is better looking and has a little fun it is.

## Why

Like many other, I am getting tried of the default project template that comes with Visual Studio.  I have been using the same one for over 4 years now.

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository

   ```Command Line
   git clone https://github.com/CodingWithDavid/BlazorServerApplicationProjectTemplate
   cd BlazorServerApplicationProjectTemplate
   ```

1.	Open in Visual Studio or Visual Code
   a.	With Visual Code you will need to install the C# extensions
2.	Press F5

## What's in the App

1. The basic Blazer server application styled with Tailwinds
2. Dark and light mode supported
3. New Blazor Thing Logo
4. Changed the H1 into spans to keep them showing focus on page load
